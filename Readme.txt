If you're trying to open the desktop file (.pbix) and want to change the query, you'll have to modify the parameters "TOP100_NICOLAS", "tracks_nicolas" and "artists_nicola" to match the location of the .csv databases located in the folder info/DB. 

Thank you very much for showing interest in our dashboard!

I hope you enjoy it as much as we did!
